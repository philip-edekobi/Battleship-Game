## **How it all started**
<p>As of now, May the 4th, 2021, I am 17 years of age.</p>
<p>I decided to venture into web development because i just loved it and i started by learning Python late last year. November, to be precise.  </p>
<p>
    I did a little Django but one bug scared me into Js lol...<br/>
    So now I'm gonna be a MERN developer.<br/>
    Javascript is fun, though i started with the Headfirst series.<br/></p>

    I learnt HTML and CSS, then proceeded to VanillaJs.<br/>
    And I told myself, to move on and convince myself that I'm ready for MERN, why not build a project. 
</p>
And i decided to share it....soooo, dig in folks.
